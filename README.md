# Run Routes

A collection of GPX running routes for various locations. This repository serves as a personal library of running routes that can be imported into running apps, GPS devices, or fitness platforms.

## What's Here

This repository contains GPX (GPS Exchange Format) files of running routes I've created or discovered. Each route includes:

- **Route Name**: Descriptive name of the route
- **Distance**: Approximate distance in kilometers/miles
- **Location**: City/area where the route is located
- **GPX File**: The actual route data that can be imported into running apps
